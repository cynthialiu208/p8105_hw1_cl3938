```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 1

Creating a data frame of:
  - a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  - a character vector of length 10
  - a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
  
```{r df_init}
p1_df = tibble(
  samp_rand_norm = rnorm(10),
  bin_if_positive = 
  
)

```

## Problem 2


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
